# Diamond Model
---
### Introduction
Composed of 4 features
1. Adversary
2. Victim
3. Capability
4. Infrastructure

There could be three other components as well
1. Social
2. Political
3. Technology

Main purpose is to carry estential concepts of intrusion analysis and adversary operations.

### Adversary

Also known as the attacker, enemy and threat.
These attacks can be a breach or an intrusion
"According to the creators of the Diamond Model,  an adversary is an actor or organization responsible for utilizing a capability against the victim to achieve their intent."

**Adversary Operator** is the “hacker”
**Adversary Customer** is the entity that stands to benefit

**Questions/Answers**
What is the term for a person/group that has the intention to perform malicious actions against cyber resources?
*Adversary Operator*

What is the term of the person or a group that will receive the benefits from the cyberattacks?
*Adversary Customer*

### Victim

This is the target of the attacker. This can be any organization, email address, domains, IP address and more.
 
**Victim Personae** are the people and organizations being targeted
**Victim Assets** are the attack surface and include the set of systems, networks, email addresses, hosts, IP addresses, social networking accounts, etc

**Questions/Answers**
What is the term that applies to the Diamond Model for organizations or people that are being targeted?
*Victim Personae*

### Capability

This is the skill, tools and techniques

**Capability Capacity** is all of the vulnerabilities and exposures that the individual capability can use. 

An **Adversary Arsenal** is a set of capabilities that belong to an adversary.

**Questions/Answers**
Provide the term for the set of tools or capabilities that belong to an adversary.
*Adversary Arsenal*

### Infrastructure

known as software or hardware.
**Type 1 Infrastructure** is the infrastructure controlled or owned by the adversary.
**Type 2 Infrastructure** is the infrastructure controlled by an intermediary
**Service Providers** are organizations that provide services considered critical for the adversary availability of Type 1 and Type 2 Infrastructures, examples ISP and Webmail providers

**Questions/Answers**
To which type of infrastructure do malicious domains and compromised email accounts belong?
*Type 2 Infrastructure*
What type of infrastructure is most likely owned by an adversary?
*Type 1 Infrastructure*

### Event Meta Features

6 possible meta-features
1. Timestamp - is the date and time of the event
2. Phase - phases of an intrusion, attack, or breach. 7 Phases:
	2. Reconnaissance  
	3. Weaponization  
	4. Delivery  
	5. Exploitation  
	6. Installation  
	7. Command & Control  
	8. Actions on Objective
4. Result
5. Direction
6. Methodology - describe the general classification of intrusion, for example, phishing, DDoS
7. Resources - every intrusion event needs one or more external resources to be satisfied to succeed. These could be software, information, hardware, funds, etc..

### Social-Political Component
Describes the needs and intent of the adversary

### Technology Component
Highlights the relationship between the core features: capability and infrastructure.
